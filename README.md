Evaluation metrics for scvi-tools models


# ‚ö†Ô∏è !! WE'VE MOVED !! ‚ö†Ô∏è   
This package is now merged into the scvi-tools package and is accessible via the `scvi.criticism` submodule.  
As part of the transition, we've also removed the generic plotting utilities. We'll give some plotting examples in upcoming scvi tutorials but otherwise will leave the freedom to end-users to use their custom plotting for their specific use case(s).  
Thanks for using this tool and please leave any future feedback under scvi-tools [issues](https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools/issues) as this repo will be archived.
